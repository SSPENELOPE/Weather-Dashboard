# Weather Dashboard

# What is this?
- This is a Weather Dashboard built using openweathermap API 
- With this weather map you can search any city you plan to travel to or currently live in and get your current
weather as well as the 5 day forecast
- I built this app as part of a requirement for my developement certification as well as a display of my work for future employers
